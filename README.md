# AI-Driven-Project-Learning-Prototype
Research prototype exploring how AI and learning analytics can enhance project-based and collaborative learning in higher education.

### Overview
This prototype investigates how **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **learning analytics** can enhance **project-based learning** in higher education.  
It simulates an intelligent collaboration environment where students are matched based on their interests and skill profiles to work on practical, skill-oriented projects.  
The goal is to make university learning more **applied, data-informed, and collaborative** through AI-driven personalization and analytics.

### Research Objective
- **Peer-Matching Algorithm:** Groups students using similarity between interests and complementary skills.  
- **Project Recommendation Engine:** Suggests suitable project ideas aligned with learners’ profiles and goals.  
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes participation, collaboration frequency, and engagement patterns.  

These components collectively support **AI-driven collaboration**, **feedback personalization**, and **learning analytics research** focused on employability and real-world learning.
