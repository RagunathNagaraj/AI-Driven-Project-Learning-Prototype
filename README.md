# AI-Driven-Project-Learning-Prototype

This research prototype investigates how artificial intelligence and learning analytics can facilitate project-based and collaborative learning in higher education.

Objective
Support applied learning by creating well-balanced student groups and providing data-driven feedback on participation and collaboration behaviors.

Research Emphasis
• Peer-matching algorithms based on interests and complementary abilities
• Task and project recommendations tailored to learner profiles
• Interaction-log analytics to monitor contribution, engagement, and teamwork assistance

These components explore how intelligent collaboration support can enhance engagement and skill acquisition in university courses.

Technical Features
• Web application for wide accessibility
• React-based interface with live updates
• Python analytics processes for recording and analyzing learner activities
• Version-controlled development and documentation

Current Progress
• Conceptual prototype using synthetic data and an analytics demonstration
• Core features drafted and in the process of refinement
• Readied for future empirical validation in an educational context
